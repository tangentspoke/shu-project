# SHU - A Blockchain Climatology Dataset Publication Platform

## Introduction

Since 1995, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) has co-ordinated the activities of climate change research institutes via the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project (CMIP).  This has led to a better understanding of past, present, and future climate, and CMIP model experiments have routinely been the basis for future climate change assessments made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Such assessments by the IPCC enable governmental policymakers and industry stakeholders to take sound, evidence-based decisions.  

## CMIP6 Archive

Under the auspices of CMIP, the WCRP has established a new set of experimental protocols known as CMIP6.  Climate modelling institutes across the globe are preparing to run very large scale, high-resolution simulations.  Once the simulations are complete, downstream research & impacts communities will run statistical & visualisation post-processing tasks.  Collectively the simulation outputs plus downstream analysis will result in a long term, distributed, citable dataset archive exceeding 1 exabyte in size.  

An archive of such magnitude requires rich metadata in order to support streamlined access to collections of datasets pertaining to specific use-cases such as, 'Understanding how clouds couple to circulations in the present climate'.  Such metadata, standardised and predicated upon so-called controlled vocabularies, describes the datasets in such a way that consumers can make sense of the datasets without having to access them directly.  This indirection is essential to minimising the amount of unnecessary stress upon the archive.  

Archive access in the interests of research is open to all, however access from the private sector may, where appropriate, be a candidate for monetisation, i.e. via charging fees.  Such monetisation requires a globalised accounting infrastructure with a revenue distribution model agreed upon by the data producers (i.e. climate modelling institutes).  Effectively this is an exercise in incubating a data market.  It should be noted that such a market requires an adaptive pricing mechanism reflecting the quality of the underlying datasets.

## Blockchain

In summary therefore, the CMIP6 dataset archive is vast, distributed and requires secure, simple, transparent, and monetisable access.  Developing the required infrastructure & concomitant applications is a non-trivial technological task.  Surveying the current technological landscape, one is struck by the extent to which distributed ledger technologies, i.e. blockchain, provides a foundational basis towards the architecture & development of such an infrastructure.  

Blockchains are secure by design and exemplify an economically strong distributed computing system with high fault tolerance.  Blockchains are suitable for the logging of events, storing records, managing identities, processing transactions, documenting provenance, voting (i.e. governance), and orchestrating complex workflows.  These capabilities can be chained together to deliver complex sets of use cases, e.g. the publication of scientific datasets.

## Proposal

Tangent Spoke is a Swiss based R & D software consultancy led by Mark Greenslade, a highly experienced software architect.  For several years Tangent Spoke has provided consultancy services to The Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL), a Paris based climate modelling institute of international repute.  Tangent Spoke, under the guidance of , & in association with the IPSL, proposes to conduct a feasibility study into the use of blockchain technologies within the context of CMIP6.  Such a study is likely to encompass the following tasks:

1. Preparation of a white paper on the potential of blockchain to deliver a decentralised dataset publication platform for CMIP6.  This white paper will be peer reviewed by IPSL partners within the international community;

2. Development of functional prototypes:  
- A publication command line client;  
- A realtime publication monitoring web portal;  
- A dataset discovery web portal;  
- A market place web portal.
